The popularity of American-centric zombie culture can be linked to fears of the Other and social anxieties over the breakdown of existing power structures. Religion, race, and gender are some of the dimensions through which empowered hierarchies manifest here in the U.S. In this project, we use the allegory of the spread of zombie infection to examine the viral spread of Hollywood representations of Voudou, coverage of the 2016 presidential election, and Beyonce's influence as a pop culture feminist icon.
