This project explores visual and textual discourse surrounding zombies, the Wild Man, and even aliens beginning in the early 20th century to present day. We discuss memes, including 'Zombie McCain' and Bear Grylls in 'I'd better drink my own piss', and ways in which these visual discourses connect with depictions of the Other across survival horror and sci-fi, in an effort to describe how these creatures serve as analogs for the time period in which they were created and perceived threats to the status quo.
