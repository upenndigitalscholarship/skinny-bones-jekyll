Engendering Zombies

Institutional Racism

Viral Fear

Aliens + Memes


FOUR COLLABORATIONS and ABSTRACTS:

Eojin Choi and Alexander Jin - Engendering Zombie Fiction
This project charts developing constructions of gender in 20th and 21st century zombie films. We focus on depictions of women and gender roles, and show how mirrors similar shifts in gender relations at Swarthmore College as one of the first coeducational colleges in the U.S.

Shuang Guan and Tiauna Lewis - How Zombies Inform Our Understanding of Racism
Coming into this class, we never would have connected zombies with racism. Now, we've learned that since the appropriation of the Haitian 'zombi', zombie narratives in the U.S. have become increasingly popular, paralleling the worries and tensions in American society. This project compares zombie narratives from the 1930s and 1950s, and those from the 2000s to now. We argue that power relations between zombies and non-zombies reflect interpersonal and institutional racism in the U.S.

Romeo Luevano and Fanyi Ma - Zombies, The Other, and the Spread of Modern Day Fear
The popularity of American-centric zombie culture can be linked to fears of the Other and social anxieties over the breakdown of existing power structures. Religion, race, and gender are some of the dimensions through which empowered hierarchies manifest here in the U.S. In this project, we use the allegory of the spread of zombie infection to examine the viral spread of Hollywood representations of Voudou, coverage of the 2016 presidential election, and Beyonce's influence as a pop culture feminist icon.

Gretchen Trupp and Jamie A. Thomas - Challenging Normal: A Linguistic Exploration of Horror and Sci-Fi
This project explores visual and textual discourse surrounding zombies, the Wild Man, and even aliens beginning in the early 20th century to present day. We discuss memes, including 'Zombie McCain' and Bear Grylls in 'I'd better drink my own piss', and ways in which these visual discourses connect with depictions of the Other across survival horror and sci-fi, in an effort to describe how these creatures serve as analogs for the time period in which they were created and perceived threats to the status quo.




The more the zombie gains notoriety as a cannibalistic anti-human across television, film, and print media, the greater its imprint as an enduring reflection of our human anxieties and fears. This born-digital exhibit offers a thoughtful analysis and creative exploration of zombie media form the perspectives of some of the genre's most avid connoisseurs. The exhibit is the collaborative effort of students in the Spring 2016 linguistics seminar, Languages of Fear, Racism, and Zombies, with instructor, Prof. Jamie A. Thomas at Swarthmore College.

In our examinations of race, gender, and power relations in the discourse of films including White Zombie, Night of the Living Dead, Pontypool, and Warm Bodies, we apply the method of Critical Discourse Analysis in multiple historical, visual, and semiotic constellations. We draw additional connections to the immortality and reanimation of the cells of Henrietta Lacks, and the early exile and objectification deemed as Other, or Wild Men, within Western culture.

We invite you to interact with our digital exhibit to learn more about why the zombie is at the center of the most important modern myth of our time. For more information, please contact jthomas6@swarthmore.edu
